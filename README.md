# Catch
This repository contains the code of the android app "Catch". 
The app allows users to play catch with their friends across a city by using their Smartphones. 
The app determines the GPS coordinates of you and your friends and synchronizes them via a firebase backend.
This allows all players to see each others location and play catch across a city similar to the boargame Mister X.
The app was written in Kotlin and uses Firebase as backend. 
"Catch" was created as part of the final Mobile Applications and Cloud Computing (MACC) course at Sapienza Universit√† di Roma.
